# Problem Statement

* You are given a java.txt file which has a class structure called ListProcessor.
* The class has 6 functions. 
  - computeSum
  - computeProduct
  - findMin
  - sortList
  - removeDuplicates
* Your task is to create a Java application from scratch, implement the ListProcessor class, and complete all the above functions. More details about the functions are in the comments of the java.txt file.
* In addition, you should also write a main method that creates an instance of the ListProcessor class and tests all the methods on a sample list of integers.
* Test your application with 3 different test cases for every function. 
* Happy coding.
