Your task is to add a function called getRange to the class ListProcessor. 
This function should basically get the range of the list of numbers. 
Range is defined as the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the list of numbers.
For example, let's say you have the following list of numbers: 3, 7, 10, 12, 15

    The largest number in the list is 15.
    The smallest number in the list is 3.
    Subtracting the smallest number from the largest number gives you the range: 15 - 3 = 12.

Therefore, the range of the list is 12.

There is a constraint in this function:
You cannot create new variables inside this function. You can only return the range of the list.
You are free to use any number of input parameters of any type.
